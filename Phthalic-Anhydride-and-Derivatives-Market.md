Phthalic Anhydride and Derivatives Market Size, Share Global Outlook and Forecast 2023-2029

The global Phthalic Anhydride and Derivatives market was valued at US$ 8158.5 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 9753.6 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 2.6% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Phthalic anhydride is a toxic, white solid crystalline compound in various forms or a clear molten liquid, with an irritating odor. It is slightly soluble in hot water, hydrolysing to phthalic acid. PA is soluble in alcohol and carbon disulphide. It reacts with strong oxidants and responds violently when heated with copper oxide or sodium nitrite, to cause an explosion hazard.Plasticizers are the important application area for phthalic anhydride, followed by unsaturated polyester resins (UPR) and alkyd resins.Phthalates are derivatives of phthalic anhydride, they are a family of chemical compounds primarily used to make polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or vinyl flexible and pliant. Phthalates are the most commonly used plasticizers in the world and are categorized as high phthalates and low phthalates, depending on their molecular weight. Among the important plasticizers, DOP and DINP are more commonly used phthalate plasticizers.
